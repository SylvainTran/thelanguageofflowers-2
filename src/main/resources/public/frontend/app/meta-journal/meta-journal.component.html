            <p>Summary: Once a warrior queen, Freyja, retreats to the ruralside to become a cheese maker.
                The king's elite duo, Catherine and Hilda, are sent by the king to convince her to fight for the empire
                again. Freyja laments the lack of vision in the younger generations of warriors.
                The queen is unconvinced of the king's plea, and shares her visions of the promised future.
            </p>            
            <h2 class="centered-text">Freyja</h2><p>A little while more, and my white horse shall ride upon the sunset.
                Three green lands of lush await to soar before my eyes; I hear happier days, mellow melodies fired from my slanted bow.
                The village of little folk and the harmony of star lovers befall my peaceful walk under late dusk. Oh, I long for the day to come upon me.                              
            </p>
            <h2 class="centered-text">Freyja</h2><p>If only brief, the churning of cheese doth resemble the quiet evening; for a fraction of a string, spontaneously it becomes a hardening mass. Its mystery is to slowly take the form of rock, yet as it was once creamy and soft.
                Transient and committed to its new destiny. Much like mine life, but in the reversed moon.
            </p>
            <h2 class="centered-text">Catherine</h2><p>Thine sight is most fortunate; my scout has been faithful in his duty.
                Hilda, there the old queen stands by the waterfall, molding her hands into a machine to make a yellow rock of sorts.
            </p>
            <h2 class="centered-text">Hilda</h2><p>Her golden hair is as fair as the bards sing in our town.</p>
            <h2 class="centered-text">Freyja</h2><p>Three nights upon the green rocks won't escape my king's arrows, I see plainly.</p>
            <h2 class="centered-text">Catherine</h2><p>Queen Freyja. liken my king to a twitching fool's dagger, fretting to erase all shadow.</p>
            <h2 class="centered-text">Freyja</h2><p>And yet he aims to profit well from sending his most elite. Must we draw blood upon the open grass?</p>
            <h2 class="centered-text">Hilda</h2><p>The night shall befall us. Heavens' scare those who take arms in the dark.</p>
            <h2 class="centered-text">Freyja</h2><p>Then explain yourselves at once for bothering my peace, or by Heavens' clerk above, I will cut the darkness itself with my bare hands and your heads next.</p><br>
            <h3>PS: I am unsure if Frejya should actually be threatening them in that situation, as she is currently cheese making. -Q</h3>

                Surely the sole of your bloodied boots have marched upon Neptunia and Grania, but it may sound uncanny that your memories will not support my king's claim. 
                For I speak with the King's word. The land of Neptunia has overturned, once where a strange blue rose's thorn covered each small tree, now each became otherwise; the thorn lost its function to harm.
                And grisly clouds and an abandoned throne for Grania - the eldest prince missing in holy lands of clouds; erst the youngest partying admist unrecommended company in orange inns. In such mad journeys, 
                there has been no straight brow of the ship - no captain of our founding Empire's blossom can sail straight fuller upon the breezy sea.
            </p>
            <h2 class="centered-text">Hilda</h2>
            <p>
                Or have you heard of the denizens of Demizia who have grown unable to carry the lightiest axe to the tree.
            </p>
            <h2 class="centered-text">Freyja</h2>
            <p>
                And ere I make cheese to please the God and me. What have thine to expect from the ones whose eyes have set to higher things yet? 
            </p>
            <h2 class="centered-text">Hilda</h2>
            <p>
                But what could be highest than to save thine kingdom.
            </p>
            <h2 class="centered-text">Freyja</h2>
            <p>
                If the leaf shakes in the forest, or the pond is disturbed in the lake meadow, or the bear hungry in the rocks, does a natural reason exist to bother the
                serene artisan in the hills?
            </p>
            <h2 class="centered-text">Catherine</h2>
            <p>
                Thee are no serene artisan, but the bloodied queen of Norsefolk, the mother of war herself. If thee be an artisan, it to be an artisan of death!
            </p>
            <h2 class="centered-text">Freyja</h2>
            <p>
                This morning I have brought the milk in the dankness of my workshop, and churned it six more times, and it became cheese. I have set my clothes to the clear water, and washed them and sang a lullaby to my God.
            </p>
            <h2 class="centered-text">Hilda</h2>
            <p>
                And hath thee thought to slaughter us where we stood and came upon your work undiscovered.
            </p>
            <h2 class="centered-text">Catherine</h2>
            <p>
                Thy feat of the sword far exceeded mine king's at the same age; thy wrists have natural grace to spin and pull at the opportune moment, and thine mind has eyes to see blows before they exist in your opponent's mind eye.
                How can thee be making cheese upon bearing such august power?
            </p>
            <h2 class="centered-text">Freyja</h2>
            <p>
                Dare you question me? That thee must be foolish to enter my homesglade in this moment, and make me utter the same words on the river's fresh. My business is to my own.
